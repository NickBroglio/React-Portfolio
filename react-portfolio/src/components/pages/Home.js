            <p className="description">Hello, my name is Nick Broglio from Jamesburg, NJ. I've been studying full-stack web development for a while
                now. I
                have studied computer science and front-end web development in the past. I have had many different types of jobs
                over
                these past few years. I have been to school and became a trained electrician. For a while I worked as a
                telecommunications installer for a security services company. My most recent trade job was working as a
                carpenter.
                After all of these I've decided to focus on a new career path in web development. Some of the reasons for this
                is my
                attention to detail and my love to create things.</p>
